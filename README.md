**Illusion Robotics 5852 Robot Code for the 2016 FRC Stronghold Season.**

This robot was designed to shoot low goals and travel through the *Low Bar*, *Chival*, *Rough Terrain* and *Rockwall* obstacles.
The robot was written in the *Java Programming Language* with a simple goal which was to be consistent, 
perform a couple things and perform them well.

There are two autonomous modes, one going under the *Low Bar* and the other
going through the *Rough Terrain*, and *Rockwall*.

The robot functions on an *Arcade Drive*, using a joystick to operate driving,
and a Logitech controller to operate the *Intake*.
